# passwdMan-project
This is a personal project to practice C++ by writing my own password manager.

At the moment The only part of the program is the password generator aspect.
To compile I suggest using Mingw64-w64
the help menue can be selected by typing "passGen h"

TODO:
*  Add more options to password generator
*  Password storage
*  Password lookup
*  Password secure storage
